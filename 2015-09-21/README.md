This Monday, we demoed Eclipse and did a [practice problem](https://icpcarchive.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=2168).

Here are my solutions to it in Python and Java. If you want to submit your own solutions, send a [pull request](http://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) or save it for the meeting.

If Github is confusing (and it really is if you're new to it), don't worry! It's a wonderful tool that we will cover at a meeting.
